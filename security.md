# On Security

Like i said [here](https://github.com/hwpplayer1/terapistonia.github.io/blob/hackers/freedom.md#why-hackers-fails-or-get-interrupted) What i offer is again collective consciousness.

So Security is the logical correctness with a cosciousness of computer hardware and software engineering. We make actions, and then we make more, the more we do the more we give effort, other people will watch related activities, and can break if we fail in mind and logical thinking.

## Solution for software engineering

I follow BSD approach for community design and on security issues. And also martial arts and any form of hacker culture. So i do not give up for any project but i know when and where to hack and how to hack. BSD is a school like dojo and gives the keys to newcomers to become an experienced one to teach or show the way to other newcomers.

A person is a person for another person. That is the spirit. And that is a solution for security.
