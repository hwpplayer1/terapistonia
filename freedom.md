# Freedom 

* A critics of hacking business

## Hacking itself

Abilities are builded day by day, or we lose them surprisely. Thinking before doing then not working for me. I have a collective approach to information which means i do not rely on any fields of science but build them like a source code together and i try to see the different views of hacking culture in the moment.

Life is a battleground and I just want to hack.

## Why working in a community

Because we live in a world not a free world maybe as we dream but we deserve that and like i said above i have a collective consciousness, but it **DOES NOT** mean that i reject different cultures or subcultures, unlike that i always support people to make their own practices in some way.

## What I do daily

I want to see far by by, every pieces and be at the moment. And I want to lead what i try to build.
